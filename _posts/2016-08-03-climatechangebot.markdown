<br>

I've been concerned about climate change for a while now. My [girlfriend](https://www.instagram.com/innainu/) and I finally found a way to share that concern with everyone else on this planet! 

It's called [climatechangebot](https://m.me/climatechangebot), the first ever climate change chat bot. If you're ever feeling concerned about climate change, feel free to chat with [climatechangebot on Facebook](https://m.me/climatechangebot). You can also post articles and keep the discussion alive on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/climatechangebot/). Maybe, just maybe, we can bring more awareness to climate change in one of the only countries with half a Congress that openly denies it. Something that the [President of Kiribati](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-to-lead-a-nation-that-will-be-swallowed-by-the-sea) calls "...the biggest infringement of human rights in history. Taking away our future. Our very existence." &#128534;

[cliamtechangebot](http://github.com/innainu/climatechangebot) was built with Flask, [Wit.ai](https://wit.ai), [Rivescript](https://www.rivescript.com), and [New York Times API](https://developer.nytimes.com).

Go chat with climatechangebot!!  &#128513;
