A cross country ski [trip](https://www.wildhikesfinland.com/winter/halti-bc-ski-tour){:target="_blank"} I wanted to take in Norway got cancelled due to COVID. So I figured I would go bike camping in Maine, socially distancing and getting a good break from the city.

I didn't have all the gear I *would* want, but after watching a few videos about [Ed Pratt riding a unicycle around the world](https://www.worldunicycletour.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Ryan Duzer riding a cruise bike across the USA](https://www.duzertv.com/){:target="_blank"}, I realized that all you really need is a bike and a tent.

4 days and ~250 miles later, I was quite happy with my decision to leap into the bikepacking world.

##### Kennebunkport to Damariscotta - Day 1

I should note that we were actually planning to bike all the way up to Schoodic on day 2. This didn't happen obviously, mostly due to the weather.

##### Belfast to Damariscotta - Day 3

It's still raining...

That was pretty much the whole day.


##### Damariscotta to Kennebunkport - Day 4

Heading back, hoping for some good weather.

After getting a flat, I popped off the back wheel and started doing a routine tube change. I didn't realize this at the time, but all the weight from my paniers broke my back axle. The ball bearings fell right out of the hub. We walked 2 miles (luckily) to the nearest bike shop to get a new axle.

We still made it to Portland, thanks to [Bath Cycle and Ski](https://www.bikeman.com/retail-store) for fixing my back axle.

[Bite into Maine](https://www.biteintomaine.com/){:target="_blank"} lobster rolls are the best I tried in Maine so far. Be sure to check them out next time you're in Portland, Maine!

Here is a pic of the full rig with my Trek 660 and the [unsaddle](https://www.skopre.com/unsaddle/){:target="_blank"}:
