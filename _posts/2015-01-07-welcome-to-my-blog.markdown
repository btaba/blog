I'm in SF on break and I just created this blog. I used [Jekyll][jekyll] with github-pages. I didn't think it would be this easy to launch honestly, but there are many templates out there that you can launch on the fly. I used the mediator template from [Dirk Fabisch][dirk] and I think it looks great. Thank you Dirk!

What spurred me to start this blog was a bitcoin challenge from my friend [Tushar][tushar]. We won some bitcoin from a [Bitcoin hackathon][hack] last fall (team Bitrec), and we really wanted to spend it in the restaurant tech scene here in SF. Unfortunately, we lost $100 worth of bitcoin since its decline. Damn! 

It's ok though, we still have some left. So the challenge was to spend a week buying food with only bitcoin (no exchange, debit, or gift cards). This came out of our excitement for eating delicious Indian food at [Curry Up Now][curry] in the Mission District. It's delicious, trust me:

I gladly took the challenge, since I want to save money on food anyways (#gradlife). The next day we went to [Bamboo Asia][bamboo]. I went to the Japanese stand, since they serve Vietnamese/Indian/Japanese in the same restaurant. I know it was already a bad sign, but a challenge is a challenge. I got a Chirashi type bowl, which was absolutely terrible. Please don't waste your money at this place! Good thing was, the cashier had no idea how to use bitcoin and I wound up getting the meal free! Glad I didn't pay for this meal:

Don't be fooled by the image, it's terrible. 

I didn't spend BTC today so I guess the challenge is over. But here's the blog! :D
