Hi this is my first time blogging. I'm in SF on break and one of the things I kind of wanted to do was to create a blog. So here it is! I've had my eyes on [Jekyll][jekyll] with github-pages. I didn't think it would be this easy to launch honestly. I used the mediator template from [Dirk Fabisch][dirk] and I think it looks great. Thank you Dirk!

What really spurred me to start this blog, was a bitcoin challenge from my friend [Tushar][tushar]. We won some bitcoin from a Bitcoin hackathon last fall, and we really wanted to spend it in the restaurant tech scene here in SF. Unfortunately, we lost $100 worth of bitcoin with its decline since then. Damn! 

It's ok though, we still have some left. So the challenge was to go one week buying food with only bitcoin (no exchange, debit, or gift cards). This came out of our excitement for eating delicious Indian food at [Curry Up Now][curry] in the Mission District. It's delicious, trust me:
