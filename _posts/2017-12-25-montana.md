I've been wanting to go cross-country skiing since my dreams were shattered last winter in Stockholm (X-country *ice-skating* instead of **skiing**).

So we made it happen in Montana at the [Izaak Walton Inn](iwinn). If you do want to visit Montana or [Glacier National Park](gnp) in the winter, I don't think there's anything else worth seeing besides the Izaak Walton Inn!

You can do stuff like this:

and this:

Resulting in pure happiness!

Hope to do it again soon!
