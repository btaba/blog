<h3><a id="section1">What is Data Science?</a></h3>
Data Science is a recent term used for extracting sense from data. It's a mix of statistics and computer science. Although most of the theoretical tools have been around for a while, the emergence of Big Data and the Internet of Things has distinguished the scale and set of skills necessary to tackle data driven problems. 

<h3><a id="section2">How can I get started</a></h3>
There are plenty of resources out there to learn most of the theory and tools that data scientists use. If you are competely new to the space, it may be good to go through a simple exercise on the [Kaggle Titanic][titanic]. 

If you want a more in-depth introduction, check out the open source [Data Science Masters][data_science_masters]. 

Once faced with some data driven problem, the steps taken from problem to solution can be broadly defined. Each step necessitates a specific skill set and tech stack.


<h3><a id="section3">Resources and Toolkits</a></h3>


Most of the basic tools used for data science involve Python, R, or other code and shell scripts. Here are some [Python Resources] and here are some [R resources]. A lot of the modeling often involves machine learning. [scikit] [rstuff]
