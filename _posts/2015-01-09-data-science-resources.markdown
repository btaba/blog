Here is some background on some of the tools you might want to use at the [Data Hackathon][dshack].

1. [How can I get started](#section1)
2. [Resources and Toolkits](#section2)
3. [Data Resources](#section3)

There are plenty of resources out there to learn most of the theory and tools that data scientists use. A great taxonomy of data science is presented [here][taxonomy]. Data scientists have different levels of expertise in five general areas: Obtaining, Scrubbing, Exploring, Modeling, and Interpreting data (OSEMN). 

If you are competely new to the space, it may be good to go through a simple exercise on [Kaggle Titanic][titanic]. Kaggle has several other tutorials and resources that they provide with their competitions.

If you want a more in-depth introduction, check out the open source [Data Science Masters][data_science_masters] Program. Given your background, as stats, CS or physics major you will find what you need to learn to become a better data scientist. As someone said before "Data scientist is a statistician who programs a lot or a CS person who works a lot with statistics" (via Reddit).

Go on to the next section to get a better idea of quick prototyping tools for the hackathon if you don't have as much time.

Most of the basic tools used for data science involve Python, R, or other code and shell scripts. 

R and Rstudio are great and easy ways to implement data science tools. You can install RStudio [here][rstudio]. We highly recommend using [Shiny][shiny] for rapid prototyping of applications you may want to build for the hackathon.

Other R resources:

1. [R cheat sheet][cran]: Go through it once and you are set to program. Then you can go use the smaller handy version [here][cran_short].
2. [This is a big book for going through content in detail.][pybook]
3. Subscribe to this [blog][rblog]. They will send you some amazing stuff daily and keep inspiring you to use R.


Here is a good way to get started downloading a [python][anaconda] environment. You may want to use [ipython notebook][ipy], which is an IDE in your browser.  

Other python resources:

1. [Using python for Data Science][PyforDataSci]
2. [Machine Learning Cheatsheet][cheatsheet]
3. [Installing ML libraries in Python][PyLibraries]
