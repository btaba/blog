I finally decided to build a computer, after using the same macbook pro for 8 years (although upgrading the RAM and SSD made it a bit easier to bare)! I highly recommend building your own computer if you don't like spending too much money on stuff (like AWS or expensive macs). The parts list is  <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/btabs/saved/Jzvf7P" target="_blank">here</a> if you wanted to check it out.
