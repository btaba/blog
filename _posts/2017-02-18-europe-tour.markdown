A two week trip to Stockholm, Chamonix, and Budapest. 

> Where I saught snow, I found ice, and where I saught ice, I found snow. But when I wanted goulash and hot baths, I found them in Budapest.


## Stockholm

At least the monarch in Sweden is illegitimate. Trumpsplaining wasn't pleasant.

Gotta get those meatballs...

I was supposed to go cross-country skiing, but there was no snow, never ending ice, and ice skates instead. Not a bad alternative!

Off to the next stop in these beautiful planes!

## Chamonix

[Mael Baguet][mael] and [Raul Castellanos][raul], amazing climbing partners. Terrifying, pushing the limits, and so fulfilling.

Rapelling off Deferlante.

## Budapest

And warm delicious goulash for less than $2 in a thriving former Jewish ghetto with warm thermal baths...not bad.
